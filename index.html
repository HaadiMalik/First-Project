        <p> Linkin Park is an iconic American rock band hailing from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band's lineup consisted of
            Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, Dave Farrell, Joe Hahn, Rob Bourdon, and Chester Bennington until his untimely death in 2017. Known for
            their fusion of heavy metal and hip hop in their early years, they later incorporated more electronica and pop elements into their
            music. Their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory, released in 2000, catapulted them to international fame and was certified Diamond
            by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Over the years, Linkin Park has sold over 100 million records worldwide,
            won two Grammy Awards, and is considered one of the best-selling bands of the 21st century. Despite the hiatus following Bennington's
            death, Linkin Park's legacy continues to influence the music industry.</p>
